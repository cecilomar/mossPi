mossPi is an automatic irrigation system written in Python and to be used with the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). The program reads a soild hydrometer sensor, and decides if irrigation is needed, then sends reports to a MySQL database.

## Current Status

 * 2014-11-22: I am still planning and just started programming.
 * 2014-11-11: Boom, I have an idea! Created a Github repository for the project.

## Motivation

I started this project because I want a moss garden, but I am away of home for long periods of time. An irrigation system will allow me to have my dream garden. 

## Contributors

For now I am handwriting every single line of the program, but I am sure that at some point I will be add a name or two here.
